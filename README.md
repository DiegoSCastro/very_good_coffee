It is also possible to change the photo that is currently displayed.

Favorites: there is an icon that activates a banner explaining how to remove an item from the favorite.
A list of favorites is displayed, each item is an image that can be clicked to view in more detail or can be dragged to the left to remove after a confirmation message

Image View: where we can see details to drag and pinch to zoom. It is also possible to select the text with the image link to copy and paste into a browser

### Packages

Unit and Widget Testing: To ensure app quality, we've implemented unit and widget tests. We've used the flutter_test and mocktail libraries to create and execute automated tests. Currently, our project has a test coverage of over 50%.

Dependency Injection: Utilized dependency injection through the get_it package. This approach enhances the separation of dependencies, making the code more modular and facilitating testing.

Local Data Storage: Implemented the sqfLite package to store data locally, enabling efficient storage of relevant information.

State Management: To employ Flutter's state management to reactively update the user interface when data changes. We've used "Bloc/Cubit" to reflect these changes in the user interface.

Image Caching: The "cached_network_image" package is utilized to efficiently load and cache web images. This enhances app performance by displaying preloaded images.
